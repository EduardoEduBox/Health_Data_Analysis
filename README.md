# Sleep Health Statistical Analysis

## Project Overview

This project investigates the relationships between demographic, lifestyle, and health factors and various sleep outcomes. By leveraging real-world sleep health data, we perform exploratory data analysis, correlation studies, and statistical tests to uncover meaningful insights into sleep patterns and their determinants.

## Dataset

- **Filename:** `sleep_health.csv`
- **Description:** Records of individuals including personal details (age, gender, occupation), sleep metrics (duration, quality), lifestyle measures (physical activity level, daily steps), and health-related indicators (stress level, heart rate, BMI category, blood pressure, and sleep disorder diagnosis).

## Notebooks

- **`Eduardo.ipynb`**: Data import, cleaning, correlation visualization, ANOVA analyses.
- **`Jolei.ipynb`**: Data cleaning, correlation strength function, chi-square tests for categorical associations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- pip

Install dependencies:

```powershell
pip install pandas numpy scipy matplotlib seaborn plotly
```

## Usage

1. Open a terminal in this project folder.
2. Install required packages.
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```powershell
jupyter notebook
```

4. Run cells in `Eduardo.ipynb` and `Jolei.ipynb` to reproduce analysis.

## Insights and Next Steps

- Extend analysis with predictive modeling or external factors.
- Develop interactive dashboards or detailed reports to communicate findings.
